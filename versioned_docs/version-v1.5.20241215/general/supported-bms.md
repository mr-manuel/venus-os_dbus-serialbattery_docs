# Supported BMS

## Most used BMS

This are the three most used BMS with this driver.

🥇 JKBMS (64% of all systems)

🥈 Jiabaida JDB BMS (16% of all systems)

🥉 Daly BMS (14% of all systems)

The Daly BMS is not recommended, if you have to buy a new BMS, since it has a bad communication implementation and
sometimes it happens that the driver is not able to fetch data for a multiple cycles.

## Currently supported

### &bull; [ANT BMS](https://antbms.vip)

Disabled by default since driver version `v1.0.0` as it causes other issues. More informations can be found in [Add other use case (grid meter) or ignore devices - ANT BMS check missing](https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery/issues/479) and if it was fixed. See [How to enable a disabled BMS](../general/install.md#how-to-enable-a-disabled-bms) to enable the BMS.

## Planned support

You can view the current [BMS requests](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/discussions/categories/new-bms-requests) to see which BMS support is requested and vote for the BMS you want to be supported.

## Add/Request new BMS

There are two possibilities to add a new BMS.

### Add by opening a pull request

Fork the repository and use the [`battery_template.py`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/blob/v1.5.20241215/etc/dbus-serialbattery/bms/battery_template.py) as template to add a new battery. As soon as the BMS works you can open a pull request (PR) to merge it.

Here is a short checklist that should help you:

- [ ] 🚨 Make sure the GitHub Actions run fine in your repository. In order to make the GitHub Actions run please select in your repository settings under `Actions` -> `General` -> `Actions permissions` the option `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`. Check also in your repository settings under `Actions` -> `General` -> `Workflow permissions` if `Read and write permissions` are selected. After this changes you have to make a new commit, if you don't see any Actions run. This will check your code for Flake8 and Black Lint errors. [Here](https://py-vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/files/linting.html) is a short instruction on how to set up Flake8 and Black Lint checks in VS Code. This will save you a lot of time.
- [ ] Add your battery class and battery class import in alphabetical order in the [`etc/dbus-serialbattery/dbus-serialbattery.py`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/blob/v1.5.20241215/etc/dbus-serialbattery/dbus-serialbattery.py)
- [ ] Add your BMS to the [BMS feature comparison](../general/features#bms-feature-comparison) page by editing [`docs/general/features.md`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/blob/master/docs/general/features.md)
- [ ] Add your BMS to the [Supported BMS](../general/supported-bms) page by editing [`docs/general/supported-bms.md`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/blob/master/docs/general/supported-bms.md)
- [ ] Do not import wildcards `*`
- [ ] If available populate `self.max_battery_charge_current` and `self.max_battery_discharge_current` with values read from the BMS
- [ ] If available populate `self.unique_identifier` with a unique value to distinguish the BMS in a multiple battery setup
- [ ] If your BMS don't run with the default settings add installation notes to the [How to install, update, disable, enable and uninstall](../general/install.md#bms-specific-settings) [`docs/general/install.md`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/blob/master/docs/general/install.md)
- [ ] If your BMS needs custom settings that the user should be able to change, add it below the `; --------- BMS specific settings ---------` section in the [`etc/dbus-serialbattery/config.default.ini`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/blob/v1.5.20241215/etc/dbus-serialbattery/config.default.ini)
- [ ] Add the new BMS to the available BMS list under `; --------- Additional settings ---------` in the [`config.default.ini`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/blob/master/dbus-serialbattery/config.default.ini)
- [ ] Add an entry to the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### Request by opening a discussion

Start a [new discussion](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/discussions/new?category=new-bms-requests) in the `New BMS request` category. Please add also the protocol documentation which you can request from the manufacturer/seller. The more upvotes the BMS request has, the higher is the priority.

If you would like to donate hardware or would like to help testing a specific BMS please get in contact over the [discussions section](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery/discussions).

## Which BMS are you using?

Please let us know, which BMS you are using with the driver by upvoting your BMS: [Which BMS are you using?](https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery/discussions/546)
