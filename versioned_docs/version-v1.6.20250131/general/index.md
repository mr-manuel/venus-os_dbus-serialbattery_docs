# dbus-serialbattery
This driver is for Venus OS devices (any GX device sold by Victron or a Raspberry Pi running the Venus OS image).

The driver interfaces with a Battery Management System (BMS) that supports serial (RS232, RS485, or TTL UART), Bluetooth, and CAN communication (see [BMS feature comparison](./general/features#bms-feature-comparison) for details). The data is then published to the Venus OS system (dbus). Its primary function is to serve as a `Battery monitor` and `Controlling BMS` in your GX device, enabling the monitoring of key values and smooth control of battery charge/discharge.

## History
The first version of this driver was released by [Louisvdw](https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery) in September 2020.

In February 2023 I ([mr-manuel](https://github.com/mr-manuel)) made my first PR, since Louis did not have time anymore to contribute to this project.

With the release of `v1.0.0` I became the main developer of this project. From then on, I have been maintaining the project and developing it further. I'm also solving 99% of the issues on GitHub.

A big thanks to [Louisvdw](https://github.com/Louisvdw/dbus-serialbattery) for the initiation of this project.

## Requirements

* GX device or Raspberry Pi with Venus OS. The latest three stable versions of Venus OS are supported. It may also work on older and newer beta versions, but this is not guaranteed.

### Optional

Depending on how you want to connect your battery, you may need one of these adapters. Normally, one adapter per BMS is needed, unless you daisy chain. Find more information on the [How to connect and prepare the battery/BMS](./connect.md) page.

* USB to UART/TTL adapter (recommended chipsets: FT230X, FT4232H or CH340)
* USB to RS485 adapter (recommended chipsets: FT230X, FT4232H or CH340)
* USB to CAN adapter
* CAN HAT for Raspberry Pi
